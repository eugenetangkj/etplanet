# ET's Planet
ET's Planet is a personal website portfolio created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can access the website [here](https://eugenetangkj.github.io/etplanet).

## Design
I self-designed the graphics used in the website. The design mainly revolves around the concept of aliens and planets since I wanted to use the idea of ET which is an acronym for both my name 'Eugene Tang' and extraterrestrials. Therefore, I drew two alien characters which can be seen throughout the website.
