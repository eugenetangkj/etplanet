# ET's Planet
ET's Planet is a personal website portfolio created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can access the website [here](https://eugenetangkj.github.io/etplanet).

## Design
I self-designed the graphics used in the website. The design mainly revolves around the concept of aliens and planets since I wanted to use the idea of ET which is an acronym for both my name 'Eugene Tang' and extraterrestrials. Therefore, I drew two alien characters which can be seen throughout the website.

## Code
I self picked up HTML, CSS and basic Javascript using online resources such as The Odin Project and YouTube. The website is created from scratch using these 3 technologies.

Note: To be exact, I used SASS instead of CSS for the ease of nesting CSS rules, but syntax follows mainly that of CSS.

- For the layout, I relied on CSS Flex and CSS Grid, depending on the requirements and contents of the web page.
- For responsive web design, I utilised media queries extensively to ensure that my website looks presentable on various screen resolutions.
- For interactivity such as the hamburger menu for mobile interfaces and image pop ups, I used basic Javascript to implement them.
- For hosting of the website, I relied on GitHub Pages which allowed me to easily make changes and publish updates from my repository.
